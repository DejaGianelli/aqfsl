## API Query Filtering and Sorting Language (AQFSL)

### Description :smiley:

AQFSL is a simple tool to parse a String that represents a query to an API Resource.
It is inspired by Uncle's Bob FSM Parser. The idea is to have a simple syntax (language) in plain text format
that can be later translated into queries to retrieve filtered and sorted api resources.
